## Brice Redmond

Brice loves to embrace a challenge, which is why he is a double major in Economics and Computer Science at UCSB. So, to further his knowledge, he is is hoping to find a position in which he can combine both of these majors. One example of this would be utilizing his computer science skills to analyze economics concepts.  
Although this is his priority, he is willing to get experience in either major wherever he can. He is currently looking for an internship for summer 2019 in Santa Barbara or the Bay Area. However, he would be interested in concurrent internships or lab positions as well.  
Once college is over, Brice hopes to go into industry and possibly graduate school further down the line. In Brice's free time, you can find him working on individual projects or playing for UCSBâ€™s ultimate frisbee team, Black Tide. On his github you can see some of the individual and group projects that he has worked on. For more about his accomplishments, you can check out his resume below as well.
